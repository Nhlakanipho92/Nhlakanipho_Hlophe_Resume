                <li style="margin-bottom: 15px;text-align: center;"><strong>Finance Calculator:</strong>&nbsp;<br> This
                    program was designed for use by a small financial company, to allow them access to two different
                    financial calculators namely; an investment calculator&nbsp;and a home loan repayment
                    calculator. This is written in the Python language.</li>
                <li style="margin-bottom: 20px;text-align: center;"><strong>Functioning PyGame:</strong>&nbsp;<br> This
                    Pygame project is a game program written in the Python language. The aim of this task was to develop
                    skills to adapt to working with novel code libraries.&nbsp;Therefore, a simple Pygame
                    program example was provided as a base to write our own game, according to the task level
                    specifications.&nbsp;This simple game includes one 'player' object, three 'enemy' objects and one
                    'prize' object.</li>
                <li style="margin-bottom: 20px;text-align: center;"><strong>Project Management System:<br>
                    </strong>&nbsp;The Task Manager Project is a program written in the Python language. The program was
                    designed to assist a small business in managing tasks assigned to each member of a team. This
                    includes
                    creating, storing, displaying and editing tasks and related information to and from text
                    files.&nbsp;</li>
                <li style="margin-bottom: 15px;text-align: center;"><strong>Advanced Project Management System:<br>
                    </strong>&nbsp; The Poised Project is a program written the Java language. The program is designed
                    to be a project management system for a small structural engineering firm called 'Poised'.&nbsp;The
                    company Poised works on various buildings in an engineering capacity to ensure structural integrity.
                    The Java program was written to assist the company in&nbsp;keeping track of the many projects that
                    they work on.</li>
                <li style="margin-bottom: 15px;text-align: center;"><strong>Poised Database Project:<br> </strong>&nbsp;
                    The Poised Database Project is a program written the Java language. The aim of this project was to
                    enhance the previous 'Poised Project Final' in Capstone Project 5,&nbsp;by incorporating
                    database programming into the project management system in place of external text files to store
                    data. A small structural engineering company could use&nbsp;this program to keep track of various
                    building projects that they are
                    working on. A database called 'PoisePMS' was created to store project data, and the dependency
                    diagram,&nbsp;as well as the Entity Relationship diagram in this repository, show the relationships
                    between the tables in the PoisePMS
                    database. Code was written in the Java language to&nbsp;then interact with the database, as well as
                    provide a main user menu.</li>
